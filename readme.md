## Settings

Basic explanations of the various editable settings within ScreenBloom.

### Global Brightness

Sets a hard limit for how bright or how dim ScreenBloom will be able to tune your lights.  Each light has its own min/max brightness settings, but the global value will always take priority.  Dynamic brightness can effectively be turned off by setting the min and max values equal to each other.

### Update Speed

Contains two settings: **Update Buffer** and **Transition Speed**.

#### Update Buffer

Sets a small delay in between update loops.  This feature was introduced to address a problem with various CPUs running the ScreenBloom update loop inconsistently, potentially leading to large delays as the Hue bridge becomes overwhelmed with commands.  This setting can provide a huge speedup on older/slower hardware.

#### Transition Speed

maps to the Hue API value for the speed of the color transition animation.  Lower values will seem more responsive while higher values will be smoother.

### Choose Display

Is a Windows-only feature allowing you to set which display ScreenBloom will parse.

### Party Mode 

Sends a random RGB color to each of your selected bulbs using your chosen transition speed.  Kind of outside the scope of ScreenBloom but I wanted the functionality and added it on a whim a few years ago.

### Screen Zones 

Will divide up the screen into discrete ScreenBloom-parsable zones.  A common use case is to split the screen in half and assign each to a light on either side of the room/TV/monitor.

### Bulbs 

Is where you select or de-select lights to be included in the ScreenBloom update loop.

### Saturation 

Arbitrarily enhances the the color ScreenBloom parses to be more vibrant and saturated.  Uses [this method](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/reference/ImageEnhance.html#PIL.ImageEnhance.Color) of [PIL/Pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/)

### Auto Start 

Determines if the ScreenBloom update loop starts automatically after the program is launched.



## Presets 

![ScreenBloom Presets Button](http://www.screenbloom.com/static/images/presets.png)

Saving a preset gathers up all your current settings, including selected bulbs and their individual settings, and saves them as a preset.  Presets can be updated by expanding their options menu and clicking **Update**, which overrides the preset with the current ScreenBloom settings.

## Performance Tips

ScreenBloom can be extremely responsive but there are a number of factors that will contribute to how well it performs.

### Hardware

ScreenBloom will run on pretty much anything but you're going to have the best results on a relatively modern quad-core system.  There's a pretty wide difference in performance between my beefy desktop gaming PC and my 2014 Macbook Pro, for instance.

### Network

You'll get the best results on a PC with a stable, wired connection.  Router configurations and firewalls can also play a role, but I don't have much data about that to say definitively.

### Number of lights

Each light that ScreenBloom addresses during its update loop adds another 2-4 commands that must be processed by the Hue bridge before continuing on to the next set of commands (i.e. the next light). 

Philips recommends a budget of ~10 commands per second to prevent bridge congestion, meaning the more lights being addressed the higher potential for congestion and slowdown.  I think the sweet spot is around 5 lights, with 1 light giving the best possible performance and anything under 10 giving pretty acceptable performance.

### Update Buffer

If you're on older hardware or are generally experiencing large delays between ScreenBloom light updates, consider experimenting with the [Update Buffer](#update-buffer) setting (located in the  [Update Speed](#update-speed) section).

## Command Line Args (Windows version)

On Windows, ScreenBloom can be launched with command line arguments.  This functionality is limited to just silent mode at the moment, I hope to expand it in the future.

### Silent Mode

Use the `-q` or `--silent` args to launch ScreenBloom without opening a browser to the web interface.  If you have autostart enabled the ScreenBloom update loop will begin.

## API

Though it wasn't really designed for it from the outset, ScreenBloom is fully addressable and scriptable as a RESTful API.

Endpoints should be pretty easy to discern from the main [screenbloom.py](https://github.com/kershner/screenBloom/blob/master/app/screenbloom.py) file, starting after the `index()` function.

Requests can be sent to the ScreenBloom web server:

`
http://<screenbloom_webserver_host>:<screenbloom_webserver_port>/endpoint
`

Example to **start** ScreenBloom update loop:

`
[GET] http://192.168.0.69:5000/start
`

**POST** endpoints accept their parameters in JSON format and will return a JSON response.  Take a look at the individual endpoint functions to figure out the exact format it expects.

## Developers

Forks and pull requests very welcome! Don't hesitate to contact me or raise an issue if you have any questions.

### Quickstart Guide:
1.  Clone the repo
2. [Grab the static files](http://www.screenbloom.com/static/distribute/screenbloom_2.2_static_files.zip)
3. Setup your **[virtualenv](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)** with Python 2
4. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`


### Sengled:
1. Python version 3.6 (Only 3.6 will work with the win32 requirement)
2. Create venv w/ env folder (python -m venv env)
3. Activate Virtual Environment (env\Scripts\activate)
- If unable to activate, run this in powershell Administrator `powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
4. pip install -r app\requirements.txt
5. if windows:
6. run `python env\Scripts\pywin32_postinstall.py -install`
7. create a file called 'cred.txt' within repo root dir and add in email & password for sengled (common separated)
8. Setup Flask app
  - One of the following set of commands should work
  - `$env:FLASK_APP="app\screenbloom.py"
    $env:FLASK_ENV="development"`
  - `SET FLASK_APP=app\screenbloom.py
    SET FLASK_ENV=development`
